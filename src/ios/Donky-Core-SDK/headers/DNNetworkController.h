 Method used to contact the Donky Network.
 This passes the network request to the Third Party AFNetworking library which is responsible for queueing, performing and receiving data from the network.
 This is the method to replace if using  AFNetworking is not possible.
 
 @param secure       if this call should use the secure API, this is only available after a device has been registered.
 @param route        the end point of the Donky Network API. These are all in DKConstants.h.
 @param method       the HTTP Verb to use, PUT/POST etc... These are all in DKConstants.h.
 @param parameters   the data that is to be sent along with the request. In NSDictionary form, the data will be parsed into JSON before being sent.
 @param successBlock block to be called upon a successful request.
 @param failureBlock block to be called upon a failure to perform the specified request.
