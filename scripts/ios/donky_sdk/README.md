These scripts enable the Donky SDK native dependencies of the plugin to be re-generated via CocoaPods. 

First run `./install.sh` to download the necessary components. They will be installed into a `cocoapod-to-cordova` subfolder.

Then run `./run.sh`. This will download each pod, build it to a temporary Xcode project, copy the compiled assets to /src/ios/ and update the references in plugin.xml

Autogenerated references will be marked in the config.xml with the `autogen='true'` attribute. Re-running `./run.sh` will wipe down existing dependencies.

Note: XCode data models are not automatically copied, so the run script explicit copies the data model of the Core SDK.
